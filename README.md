If you're a JavaScript developer, you already know that working with data is a big deal. Why let the Python and R coders get all the glory? JavaScript isn't just good at data visualization, you can move your entire data wrangling pipeline to JavaScript and work more effectively. [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2) teaches you core data munging techniques in JavaScript, along with many libraries and tools that will make your data tasks even easier.

This repository contains completed code for a D3 visualization of space junk covered in Chapter 13 (*Advanced visualization with D3*) of [Data Wrangling with JavaScript](http://bit.ly/2t2cJu2).

Please install dependencies with bower before running. You can run this example using any web-sever, I recommend [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server).

## Getting it running

Clone the repo, open a command line and change directory into the repo, then...

Install dependencies:

    bower install

Make sure you have live-server (or similar web server) installed globally:

    npm install -g live-server

Run the web server in the repo directory:

    live-server

A browser should open and load the web page. You should see the visualization.
